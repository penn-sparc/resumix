### Task Objective:
Parse the input job description into a structured format. Each section of the content should correspond to one of the labels. If a particular section is not present in the content, keep the label in the output with an empty string.

### The labels are:
- Overview (Job Title, Location)
- Responsibilities
- Requirements Basic
- Requirements Preferred

### Requirements:
1. The output must be in valid JSON format.
2. Each label should be a top-level field in the JSON, and its value should contain the corresponding content.
3. Try to preserve the original expressions; do not rewrite, summarize, or omit.
4. If the content includes bullet points, keep their original structure.
